<hr>
<p>The design of the site is very fitting for the services.  It has a huge directory that shows you the 
catalog with its subdeivisions; sale with its subdivisions; clearence with its subdivision, and so on 
like that.  So every single page on the site can be reached from this page, just one click.  I think that is very nice and make the site 
incredibly easy to use.  They have a background image to the left of the site and it shows 
various reptiles which looks very nice.  The color scheme is green which is fitting for a 
reptile shop.  The thumb nail images are of the ball pythons that they have for sale at the shop.  You can click on the images and it take you to another page that shows a much larger 
photograph of the snakes as well as a brief description of the animal and its price.  
The col thing about this larger image is that when you hover the mouse over the animal it zooms in on the 
location of the hand, it is amazing quality, it really does justice to the snakes beautiful colors
 and such.  The images are JPEG images which must account for the vividness of the pictures.  When I 
validated this particular page there were 16 errors.  There we a lot of uneccassry things for headers and 
elements, and they keep putting an attribute to the element meta which was not allowed.  All in all 
it was a stand up site, with the best features being the directory with just one click taking you anywhere, and the thumbnail images with the ability to zoom in to 
specific images with the mouse.   <p>
