<h1>Website Review #4</h1>

<hr>
<p> Right from the start I can see that there is a huge amount of detail and work that went into making these sites.  But I have to say that I like some
designs better than others; some are more user friendly than others.  I thought it was really cool how when you would click on the site labeled Garments that the site would sort of appear into veiw from a blank page.
I thought that was really cool and I would like to know how to do that!  Some sites also have the other links to the other designs at the top of the page
or at the bottom, I would much rather prefer that these links would stay at the side of the page and follow you as you scroll up and down the page. That would make the site far more user friendly in my opinion; it would just make it easier to use. But if
the designer did not want to do that, I would prefer that the links at least be at the top of the page.  I definetly liked the lighter colored pages as well,
I hated the look that steel had, it was just ugly.  In terms of purpose thay all do a great job of showing us all the amazing things that can be done with CSS code!
  There are only a handfull of errors that could be fixed in a couple of minutes so as far as that goes it seems alright.<p>
