<hr>
<p> This site was a mix of Ice and Liquid designs.  The majority of the text and site information was on the left of the page.  The right side mostly held adds.  The entire page was also taken up by the content on the page, there were almost no margins. But when you click on the news articles there is a subastancial margin for the text which makes it easy to read.  When you would scroll through the site the heading and/or directory bar would not follow you.  I did not like that part of the site as it felt like I was using a less complex version of wikipedia.  The webpage isnt very long so they substitued a moving directory with just having two of them on the page; one at the top of the site and one at the bottom of the site.  The two directory bars also follow you to whichever page you move to which is nice.  I think adding margins would make the site more aesthetically pleasing to the user.  All in all it is a solid site, but there are definetly some things that I would like to change if I was put in charge of it. I personally think that Fluid/Jello designs look best to me. <p>
