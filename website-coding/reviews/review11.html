<p>Godaddy was by far the best site.  It showed what you searched for and had it in a .com form.  It also showed other names 
if you would prefer somthing else along the same line.  It was very very very easy to use and the costs were very cheap.  Namecheap did not have many typical 
TLDs as the other sites had.  Not very aesthetically pleasing.  Pretty easy to use.  Network solutions instantly adds what you search for into the checkout cart which I did not like at all. 
Made me feel rushed, and I imagine that others would feel the same way.  Register is pretty much the same site as Network Solutions, relativly easy to use but it 
did not compare well to Godaddy in terms of options and visuals.  Buy Domains never Even Loaded!  It would not load even when I used three different 
search engines.  They all served there purpose; some better than others.    <p>
