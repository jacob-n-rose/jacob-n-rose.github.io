<hr>
<p>I took a look at the FAQ page of Muriskate.com and I was giant.  They have some general organization near the top organized into 1. General Skate Questions 2. Choosing What to get 3. Placing an Order 4. Scott's Most Frequently Asked Questions  5. Gift Card FAQ. Under these subjects hold the many one line questions underneath.  So you can click on a question and then the page will fly down to the question any distance down the page.  It works like wikipediaand it is very nice.  So then you could Imagine how long the page is.  The only drawback to this is that you have to scroll all the way back up to get to the top of the page. All in all it is a very organized FAQ site and is super easy to navigate, any person could use it.  If the site was full of links to different questions it would just be ugly.  The site did have 70 errros when I checked it, but it doesnt look complicated to fix, it was basically the same issue 60 times for the links.  The site was using an obsolete "name" attribute.</p>
<p> I think this is a well made site, easy to navigate, and fast to use.</p>
