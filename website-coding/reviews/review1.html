<h3>Website review of lllreptile.com</h3>
 <p>The navigation of the site is excelent.  The site intially looks pretty simple but all of the drop down tabs on the site are very diverse. This is an excellent site that is very descriptive about its products, espicially the animals it has for sale.  Each animal has its own discrition of the specific animal size and the age.
</p> 
<p>As you click down on the tabs you can get more and more specific specific about what you are looking to buy, it also doesnt make you lave the page.  The top tool bar stays with you the whole time so that you dont have to back out to return to the home page, very slick!  This site is user friendly, I bet my grandmother could easily navigate and order things form the site.
 </p>
<p>I checked the site on Validator.w3.org and it had 11 errors that should be fixed.  I also noticed that hey used HTML5 probably because it is a newer site and that the use a ton of photographs on their site, which is easy to accomplish with HTML5 vs XHTML.  
</p>
<p>I check this site frequently and will use it to order my next reptile!</p>
