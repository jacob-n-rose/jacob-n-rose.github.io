<h1>Website Review #9</h1>
<h3><a href="https://myspace.ge/user/register">MySpace Sign-up</a>  </h3>

<hr>
<p>The site uses several differnet input types.  The "hidden" type is used for coving something up called core[security_token]; I assume it is for security purposes.  The next type I 
saw was the common "text" textbox.  This was used for the input of the users full name and the users username.  
Next is "password", which was used for the user to type in a password which would show up as ***'s on the screen.  
Then "file", for uploading a picture which then become the profile picture of the user.  
Before that was the "radio" and "select" to choose the date of birth and location of the user narrowed down to country.  
Lastly there was the "submit" type; which is used to submit the entire form to MySpace so that a profile can then be created.  
I was supried to not see a "reset" type but, there wasn't a huge amount of information that 
had to be given so it would be a big nuisance to just go box to box and delete the data.  The site was easy to use 
but it was very ugly in my opinion.  They only had one design there and it was an ugly 
shape silloutte drawing.  There were also adds at the top and bottom of the page 
which made it feel like a lesser competitor to facebook and the like which are kicking 
MySpace while it is down.  One thing I have to say is that the html for myspace is very 
well organized compared to facebook which was just a giant paragraph of code; terrible!  So, A+ for MySpaces html organization.  <p>
