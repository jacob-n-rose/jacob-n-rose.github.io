<h1>Website Review #10</h1>

<hr>
<p>The overall layout of the site is very nice.  It has its title with a 
quick and iny description right there at the top.  The coolest part is that the title 
area has a background video on it of a guy running on this beautiful beach; it 
seems like it was filmed with a drone.  The sites purpose is to offer videos up to customers and 
it delivers.  Right under the title/cover area is the navigation bar which has holds nine possible genres of videos.  
When you click on the individual genres the 5 or 10 videos classified as that pop up right underneath.  It is very smooth.  
Underneath the videos that pop up they even show you how to input the videos into 
your HTML code!  This site is super easy to use and navigate.  I belive the creator of this 
site used video elements instead of Embedding a flash file beacuse these are videos that the creator eiher filmed or owns.  You can tell 
that the video quality is the exactly the same for all videos.  And, if they want high traffic on their site it would be a bad idea to be 
uploading the videos to youtube.   <p>
