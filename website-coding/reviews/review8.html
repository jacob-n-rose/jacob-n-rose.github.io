<hr>
<p> This site is all about wiehgt lifting standards for 
olympic lifts such as bench, press, power clean, and deadlift.  
This particular page shows the Adult Male lifting standards 
for the Deadlift.  It has 6 table heads (th) which include the Body wieght and the lifting standards 
that they should be at from weigths ranging from 95lb to 615lb based on skill level and weight of the 
individual. It is a very simple stite that is easy to use.  
CSS is the preferred mothod for controlling the layout of a site because of a couple of reasons.  HAving the formatting on a separate page makes 
the construction of the site much easier to read and understand; and it is quicker with the use of elements to change whole areas of text.   <p>
